# Social_Media_Web
Corizo Major Project for Internship

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Social media is all that we are surrounded by in todayâ€™s world. There are a lot of social media apps and websites that we use in our daily lives like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. A very good full-stack project can be developing your own social media app. A social media app/website is not like a chat application. Here, people can post an image/video/text, and others can like/dislike, comment, and share them. It is like forming a network of people. This project is a very good project for the practice of both front-end and back-end
